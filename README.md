## Overview
- We live in a world where new things related to AI are pouring out every week. Nowadays, even using any LLM makes basic coding incredibly easy. Honestly, I believe that even the most complex and difficult problems can be solved by breaking them down into workflows using the CoT (Chain of Thought) method and modularizing them, under the assumption that humans can solve them. 

- So, does that mean developers are no longer needed? Of course not. No way. If youâ€™re a non-major, youâ€™ve probably felt frustrated or disappointed at times when using AI. Why is that? Itâ€™s because you lack the 'common sense' of an expert. If you know nothing about computers and get upset at garbage results after asking a question, itâ€™s like a toddler babbling incoherently, throwing a tantrum on the floor because no one understands them. You need to know what you want and what youâ€™re doing to get good results. 

- With a bit of common sense, youâ€™ll move beyond the toddler stage in the field of computer engineering and learn how to communicate. Once you reach an intermediate level, itâ€™ll become easier to talk not just with AI but also with experts. And finally, when youâ€™ve grasped all the common sense comprehensively, thatâ€™s when you become an expert. Itâ€™s not a big dealâ€”just a matter of learning how to communicate.
